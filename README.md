This is my app.tsx file this is where I first did majority of my coding when I started part 2 of this module however, I have refactored the app to have multiple components which are my screens, so I had to move all my code once I started the final POE.

This is the code for my homescreen I removed the coding from the app.tsx file and created a new folder called src this folder contains multiple sub folders and on of those being the components sub folder this sub folder contains the file for my homescreen I have made sure to optimise this code as much as possible to create a visually appealing and functional home screen.

This is the entirety of my add menu item screens code this is where I have added the arrays to store the menu items as well as the descriptions and pricing this was also originally in app.tsx however I have also refactored this into the components sub folder this is to keep my code need and legible I have also got a remove item button on this screen.


 
GuestViewScreen.tsx

This is my guest view screen this is pretty much a read only screen however there is functionality in using buttons to allow guests to filter by course there is also a price next to every menu item as well as boxes to contain the items. This was also originally in the app.tsx file however I have refactored this into the components sub folder.


 
Index.ts
 <img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142729" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1e8202-d34b-48f4-ac57-b17b20834384" />

This short bit of code is to define my courses this is kept in a completely different sub folder known as types this was to help neaten up any unnecessary code in the app.tsx file.

 
Images.ts
 <img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142733" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0894d3-db0d-4165-a69b-4dcbdfadf82c" />

This file is also in a different folder all together this is under the sub folder called constants however the images I have provided are AI generated and I will provide the reference at the end of the page for these images I have done this so that my code is neater and easier to understand I did not want image links throughout all my code this helped to shorten my code however images can be added so that the chef can update the images with every new menu item added.

 
Calculations.ts 
<img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 160123" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e64dc6b-7ad1-4f6f-b758-a9a2d659332e" />
<img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 160132" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c5cbea-eef1-443d-80c3-b5d1aa2b7d62" />

 
This is my calculation code this is where all the calculations for the average prices are calculated this was also refactored and placed into a subfolder called utils this was also to keep my code clean and easily understandable.

 
Helpers.ts
 <img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142748" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52327a0d-340a-4ff7-a479-1d2ad86ef82e" />
<img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142755" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ccafea-d2f5-46a4-a140-d27f27518298" />

 
This is my helpers file this is also in the utils sub folder, and this block of code pretty much helps with error handling making sure that all fields are filled and checks if everything required is input correctly.

 
Sharedstyles.ts
 <img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142802" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485d69e2-6932-4ccb-afa4-20b3ae09dbdc" />

This is my shared styles file this is kept in the sub folder called styles a lot of the styling for the individual screens is kept in there respective files however this file is to keep a uniform look throughout the entire app this is styles shared by every screen all screens are linked to this folder this means they share the same background image as well as opacity among other things.

 
APP UI/UX
HOME SCREEN

This is my apps home screen this where the chef can view the menu and the prices as well as the average price of the entire menu as well as each individual course average price, he can also view the number of items on the menu.

 
ADD MENU ITEM SCREEN
 <img width="1920" height="1032" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 142919" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a62d8f24-82ce-414b-9864-1ca3c1109cef" />

This is the screen that allows the chef to add items to the menu this screen is also where the chef can remove menu items when he wants to replace those items.

 
GUEST VIEW SCREEN

This is where the guests of the restaurant can view the menu there will be items on the menu when I demonstrate the app in the video and it will show the item as well as description and the price of the item. This is also a filter screen so the guests can filter by course to see the different items in each course.
